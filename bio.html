        Hover over my picture! My name is Gerome Maisog. I enjoy traveling the world and talking about it. Some of my travles have brought me to the UK, China, Japan, Egypt, and Greece. I
        Graduated <a href="https://vt.edu/">Virgina Tech</a> with a 4.0 gpa and currently work as a garbage collector. I have no friends or family and have no hobbies 
        other than travel. One day I would like to go to Spain and become a famous rapper.
